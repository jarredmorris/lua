A compiler for the full Lua programming language built in Python.

Sadly since finishing on this project in Spring 2017, I no longer have the git history and simply have the .py file from my university submissions portal. However, the compiler itself is still here in all of its working glory! It simply lacks my commit messages. 
Note that by the request of the module organiser, I had to place the entire program into a single Luaparser.py file, in time I may split it back out into more semantically meaningful files!
